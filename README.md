**[pygame-joystick-test][]** is a small Python program that uses [pygame][] to test joysticks. Upon running, it shows the state (axes, trackballs, hats and buttons) of all detected joysticks. It's a quick and simple way to check how well your joystick works. It was written in 2007-09-09 using Python 2 and that code still runs in 2020 in Python 3.

Requirements:

* Python 2 or 3
* [pygame][] 1.x (untested in pygame 2)
    * I expect `pygame-joystick-test` to be compatible with any system that is supported by `pygame`.
